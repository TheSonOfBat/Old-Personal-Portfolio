# Old-Personal-Portfolio
https://thesonofbat.github.io/Old-Personal-Portfolio/
This was my old personal portfolio website, designed and created in late 2021. This was my initial attempt on creating a brand for myself as a front-end dev. It was populated with placeholder projects and was mainly a test of my designing and implementation. It was during this time however I was able to create the logo I now as a symbol of myself as a developer.
## Potential Improvements
Itâ€™s been a while since I actually made this project and hence can provide some oversight into how I would change it for the better if I wanted to re-develop it for future purposes. First off, the project was created without React which is something I would immediately attempt to introduce as it would allow easier creation of projects as the data such as images and info of the projects could be stored externally from the HTML file itself and then mapped into components and rendered in. Due to its innate simplicity probably the only other significant change that stands out  would be an overhaul of the design as I have learnt to adapt more best practices in what I develop alongside understanding how to make more complex UIs that have a stronger focus on UX. 
## Final Notes
Overall, this project was an important milestone in my progress as a developer as it pushed not only my technical skills but also my ability to create my own designs. This was one of most challenging projects to design as I equally wanted it to showcase my ability to design something that was clean and accessible whilst also showing I could translate it to code.
