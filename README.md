# Old-Personal-Portfolio
My old personal portfolio website, designed and created in late 2021. This was the intial attempt on creating a brand for myself as a front end dev. It was filled with placeholder projects and was mainly a test of my designing and implementation. It was during this time however I was able to create the logo I now as a symbol of myself as a developer.
